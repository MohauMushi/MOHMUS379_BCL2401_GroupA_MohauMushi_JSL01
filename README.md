## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to create a JavaScript function that validates the syntax of pet adoption details entered by the user. The function will check if the input string starts with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input adheres to this specific syntax, the function will return "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, it will return "Invalid Syntax." By achieving this objective, the virtual pet adoption website will ensure that accurate and consistent pet adoption details are submitted by the users.

## key Features
1. JavaScript Validation Function: Develop a JavaScript function capable of validating the syntax of pet adoption details.

3. User Feedback: Provide clear feedback to the user by returning "Valid Syntax" if the input is in the correct format, and "Invalid Syntax" if it does not meet the required syntax.
